I think this is one of the best films ever made. I'm very much into things that are creepy and sick, so this was right up my alley. It wasn't as scary as I suspected. It was more suspenseful than scary. There is obviously violent/disturbing content, since it's about serial killers and all. I'm not going to elaborate on each instance of disturbing content because it would take too long. As for sexual stuff, a prisoner flicks semen at Clarice in one scene, and Buffalo Bill is shown dancing naked in front of a mirror with his penis tucked between his legs. All of the acting is phenomenal, but I feel like the other actors get overshadowed Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. Lecter is easily the best villain in film history, and Anthony Hopkins is superb. The way that serial killers were portrayed in this film is chillingly realistic. The story has you on the edge of your seat the whole time.",2019-03-03 19:09:10.653066,2019-03-03 19:09:10.653066,1
